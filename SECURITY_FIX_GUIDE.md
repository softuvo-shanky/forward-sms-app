## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices:**

### **Never Commit Credentials:**

- ❌ **Never** commit `.env` files with secrets
- ❌ **Never** put API keys in documentation

### **Use Environment Variables:**

- ✅ Use `.env` files (add to `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

### **App Configuration:**

- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in app
- ✅ Settings stored locally on device only

## 📱 **How the App Works Now:**

1. **User installs app**
2. **User enters their own SMTP settings** in the app

4. Use this new password in the app

## ✅ **Repository is Now Secure:**
