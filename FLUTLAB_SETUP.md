# FlutLab.io Setup Guide

## ✅ Problem Solved!

I've added the required iOS directory structure to make your project compatible with FlutLab.io. The error "The following file is required for a Flutter project: ios/" should now be resolved.

## 📁 What I Added:

### iOS Directory Structure:
```
ios/
├── Flutter/
│   ├── AppFrameworkInfo.plist
│   ├── Debug.xcconfig
│   ├── Generated.xcconfig
│   └── Release.xcconfig
├── Runner/
│   ├── AppDelegate.swift
│   ├── Assets.xcassets/
│   │   ├── AppIcon.appiconset/
│   │   └── Contents.json
│   ├── Base.lproj/
│   │   ├── LaunchScreen.storyboard
│   │   └── Main.storyboard
│   ├── Info.plist
│   └── Runner-Bridging-Header.h
├── Runner.xcodeproj/
│   └── project.pbxproj
└── Podfile
```

## 🚀 How to Use with FlutLab.io:

### 1. Upload Your Project
1. Go to [FlutLab.io](https://flutlab.io)
2. Create a new project or upload existing
3. Upload your entire project folder (including the new `ios/` directory)
4. The error should now be resolved!

### 2. Build APK
1. Once uploaded, select "Build APK"
2. Choose "Release" build for production
3. Wait for the build to complete
4. Download your APK file

### 3. Install and Configure
1. Install the APK on your Android device
2. Open the app and go to Settings
3. Configure SMTP with your credentials:
   - **SMTP Host**: `smtp.gmail.com`
   - **SMTP Port**: `587`
   - **Username**: `[YOUR_EMAIL]@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `[YOUR_APP_PASSWORD]`
   - **Sender Email**: `[YOUR_EMAIL]@gmail.com`
   - **Recipient Email**: `[RECIPIENT_EMAIL]@gmail.com` (or any email)

## 📱 Project Features:

- ✅ **FlutLab.io Compatible**: Now includes required iOS files
- ✅ **Android SMS Forwarding**: Captures and forwards all SMS
- ✅ **SMTP Email Integration**: Sends formatted emails
- ✅ **Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive interface
- ✅ **Permission Handling**: Proper SMS permissions

## 🔧 Technical Notes:

- The iOS files are minimal and only required for FlutLab.io compatibility
- The app is designed for Android but includes iOS structure for build tools
- All functionality remains Android-focused
- No iOS-specific features are implemented

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Upload to FlutLab.io** - The project should now upload without errors
2. **Build APK** - Use FlutLab's build system to create your APK
3. **Test on Device** - Install and configure with your SMTP settings
4. **Enable SMS Forwarding** - Toggle the switch and test with a sample SMS

The project is now fully compatible with FlutLab.io and ready for APK generation!
